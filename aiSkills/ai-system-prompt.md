## CONTEXT FILE STRUCTURE (what you receive from the user)

The user will upload one or more `*-context.txt` files. Each file has this structure:

```
<project name="SectorAnalysis.WebApi" files="12">
<file path="SectorAnalysis.WebApi/Controllers/SectorsController.cs" lines="85">
// full source code of the file
</file>
<file path="SectorAnalysis.WebApi/Program.cs" lines="42">
// full source code of the file
</file>
</project>
```

Key things to note:
- The `<project name="...">` tells you which project layer you are reading (e.g. WebApi, DataProvider, SharedContracts).
- File `path` attributes use **forward slashes** and are **relative to the project root** with no leading `./`.
- The path **always includes the project folder as the first segment**: `SectorAnalysis.WebApi/Controllers/SectorsController.cs` — NOT `Controllers/SectorsController.cs`.
- **Copy the path exactly as shown in the context file** when writing your `<file>`, `<patch>`, and `<delete>` blocks. Do not strip the project folder prefix just because you know which project you are in.
